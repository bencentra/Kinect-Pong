kinect-pong
===========

An implementation of Pong in a C# WPF application, using the Microsoft Kinect for controls.    

Uses [WpfKinectHelper] (https://github.com/bencentra/WpfKinectHelper) for interfacing with the Kinect. 

Made by [Ben Centra](https://github.com/bencentra).   

How To Play
-----------

It's Pong; try and bounce the ball past your opponent's paddle without letting the ball get past yours.

**Controls:**
1) Select the handedness of each player in the options on the left.    
2) Stand in front of the Kinect. The player on the left is Player One (blue), the player on the right is
Player Two (red).    
3) Raise and lower your selected hand to move your paddle and block the ball.    

Future Improvements
-------------------
* Further fine-tuning for collisions, angle randomization, etc.    
* Single player mode.
